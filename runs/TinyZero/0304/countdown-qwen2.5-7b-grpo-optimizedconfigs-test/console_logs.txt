[stdout] Target: 97 | Numbers: [26 89 74 86]
[stdout] Extracted equation: 89 + 74 - 86 + 4
[stdout] Solution string: A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer.
User: Using the numbers [26, 89, 74, 86], create an equation that equals 97. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and each number can only be used once.

I have to find a combination of numbers that add up to 97. Let's try to start with 89, the closest number to it.

97 - 89 = 8

Now, I need to find a way to get 8 from the remaining numbers. The only way to do that is to subtract 26 from 92 (86 + 26 = 112, so 112 - 86 = 26).

92 - 26 = 66, which is still not 8. Let me try another subtraction.

92 - 86 = 6

Now, I need 8 - 6 = 2. I can get that by dividing 86 by 4.

86 / 4 = 21.5, but since I cannot use decimals, let me check other options.

86 - 74 = 12

Now, I just need 8 - (86 - 74) = 8 - 12 = -4, which is not possible.

Let's try a combination of addition and subtraction.

86 + 89 = 175, but that's too high. I can subtract 74 from it.

175 - 74 = 101, too high again. Let me try another option.

89 + 74 = 163, also too high. I can subtract 86 from it.

163 - 86 = 77

Now, I need 97 - 77 = 20. I can get that by adding 10 and 10.

10 + 10 = 20.

Now, I need to find two numbers that add up to 10. They could be 2 and 8, or 4 and 6.

But since I have 26 already used, I can only use 4 and 6.

89 + 74 - 86 + 4 = 97.

The equation is <answer> 89 + 74 - 86 + 4 </answer>.<|endoftext|>

[stdout] Target: 82 | Numbers: [52 27  3]
[stdout] Extracted equation: (52 + 27 + 3)
[stdout] Solution string: A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer.
User: Using the numbers [52, 27, 3], create an equation that equals 82. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and each number can only be used once. Show your work in <think> </think> tags. And return the final answer in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer> (1 + 2) / 3 </answer>.
Assistant: Let me solve this step by step.
<think>First, I can observe that adding the three given numbers (52 + 27 + 3) equals 82.
Using this, I can create a simple equation: (52 + 27 + 3) = <answer>82</answer>
However, since each number can only be used once, I need to figure out a way to use the given numbers and obtain the result of 82.</think>
<answer>(52 + 27 + 3)</answer><|endoftext|>
[stdout] Correct equation: (52 + 27 + 3) = 82
