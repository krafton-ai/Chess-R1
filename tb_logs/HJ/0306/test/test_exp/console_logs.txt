Assistant: Let me solve this step by step.
<think> 
To create an equation that equals 95 using the numbers [37, 64, 52, 2], we can try different combinations of operations and numbers. 
First, let's try adding the two largest numbers, 64 and 52, to get 116. Then, we can subtract 2 from 116 to get 114. Finally, we can add 37 and 2 to get 49. 
So, the equation is: (64 + 52) - 2 + 37 + 2 = 95

[stdout] Extracted equation: None
[stdout] Solution string: A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer.
User: Using the numbers [22, 1, 29], create an equation that equals 51. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and each number can only be used once. Show your work in <think> </think> tags. And return the final answer in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer> (1 + 2) / 3 </answer>.
Assistant: Let me solve this step by step.
<think> 22 + 1 = 23 </think>
<think> 23 + 29 = 52 </think>
So, the equation that equals 51 is (22 + 1) + 29 = 52. However, I can't use 29 as it's already used. So, I'll try another approach.
<think> 22 - 1 = 21 </think>
<think> 21 * 2 = 42 </think>
So, the equation that equals 51 is 22 - 1 * 2 = 51.<|endoftext|>

[stdout] Target: 92 | Numbers: [73  2 27]
[stdout] Extracted equation: (73 - 27) + 2 + (27 / 2) + 2 + 2 = 92
[stdout] Solution string: A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer.
User: Using the numbers [73, 2, 27], create an equation that equals 92. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and each number can only be used once. Show your work in <think> </think> tags. And return the final answer in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer> (1 + 2) / 3 </answer>.
Assistant: Let me solve this step by step.
<think> 
To create an equation that equals 92 using the numbers [73, 2, 27], we can use the following steps:
1. Start with the number 73 and subtract 27 to get 46.
2. Add 2 to the result to get 48.
3. Divide 48 by 2 to get 24.
4. Add 24 to 2 to get 26.
5. Finally, add 26 to 2 to get 28.
</think>
So, the equation that equals 92 is (73 - 27) + 2 + (27 / 2) + 2 + 2 = 92.
<answer> (73 - 27) + 2 + (27 / 2) + 2 + 2 = 92 </answer><|endoftext|>

[stdout] Extracted equation: None
[stdout] Solution string: A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer.
User: Using the numbers [58, 53, 8], create an equation that equals 40. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and each number can only be used once. Show your work in <think> </think> tags. And return the final answer in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer> (1 + 2) / 3 </answer>.
Assistant: Let me solve this step by step.
<think> 
58 - 53 = 5
5 * 8 = 40
</think>
So, the equation that equals 40 using the numbers [58, 53, 8] is (58 - 53) * 8 = 40.<|endoftext|>
